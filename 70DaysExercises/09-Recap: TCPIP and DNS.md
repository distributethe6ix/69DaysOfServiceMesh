## 9 - Recap: TCPIP and DNS
**Informational**
> *LETS break TCP/IP*

#### What is TCP/IP
Welcome to Day 09 :smile:!!!

 TCP stand for **(Transmission Control Protocol)**. This is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct order, while IP **(Internet Protocol)** and it is responsible for routing the data to its destination.

### How TCP/IP relate to DNS?

TCP/IP and DNS work together to enable users to access websites by translating domain names into IP addresses and then transmitting data over the internet using the TCP/IP protocol.

TCP/IP and DNS are two fundamental protocols that work together to make the internet work. TCP/IP provides the underlying transport mechanism for transmitting data over the internet, while DNS provides the system for translating domain names into IP addresses that can be used by TCP/IP to route data.

When a user wants to access a website, they type the domain name into their web browser. The browser sends a DNS query to a DNS server to obtain the IP address associated with that domain name. Once the IP address is obtained, the web browser uses TCP/IP to establish a connection with the web server associated with that IP address. The TCP protocol is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct order, while the IP protocol is responsible for routing the data to its destination.
