### What is the Gateway API?Â¶
In Kubernetes, a Gateway API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that enables communication between different microservices within a cluster. It allows multiple microservices to work together to fulfill a larger application. It is a collection of resources that model service networking in Kubernetes. These resources `GatewayClass` `Gateway` `HTTPRoute` `TCPRoute` `Service` etc.
