- clone the project locally
```
git clone https://github.com/github_username/70DaysOfServiceMesh/
```
- Add upstream url
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/distributethe6ix/70DaysOfServiceMesh/
```
- create a new branch
```
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```
- commit your changes
```
git commit -m "your message"
```
- Push your changes
```
git push origin <your_branch_name>

```
